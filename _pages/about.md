&emsp;&emsp;I am currently pursuing a PhD in Computer Science at the University of Auckland since 2023. Previously, I was a visiting student at Southwest University during 2019 - 2022. Prior to that, I completed an MSc in Software Engineering at Southwest University in 2019 and a BSc in Software Engineering at South-Central Minzu University in 2016. My current research specialises in relational database theory with a focus on data normalization techniques and anomaly detection from system logs.<br> 
&emsp;&emsp;Specifically, my work mainly consists of the following areas:
- *Schema Design Optimization*:  
  Developing novel normalization algorithms to minimize data redundancy and improve update efficiency while preserving functional dependencies. 
- *Update Cost Reduction*:  
  Quantifying the trade-offs between normalization levels and update overheads in databse systems.
- *Mining FDs/Keys from Data*:  
  Mining some meaningful Functional Dependencies/Keys from data with domain expert knowledge.
- *Detecting Anomalies from System Logs*:  
  Mining anomalous patterns from system logs to find root causes via deep learning techniques.
